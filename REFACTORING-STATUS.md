# Folder Structure Refactoring Status

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Created new directory structure with features-based organization:

   - `src/features/events/` for event-related code
   - `src/features/registration/` for registration-related code
   - `src/features/admin/` for administration features
   - `src/shared/` for shared components and utilities

2. ✅ Created specialized files for each feature:

   - Added type definitions in each feature directory
   - Fixed validation schemas to be in the correct feature directory
   - Set up proper exports through index files

3. ✅ Fixed shared components:

   - Updated all shared components to use default exports
   - Fixed the imports in key layout components
   - Added necessary type definitions to components

4. ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors:

   - Corrected styling issues in email templates
   - Fixed exports and imports that were causing TypeScript errors

5. ✅ Fixed critical missing components:

   - Added UnregisterButton to both registration and events features
   - Moved CheckRegistrationStatus and CapacityDisplay to events feature
   - Added action buttons and admin components

6. ✅ Updated key imports:

   - Updated src/app/events/[id]/page.tsx
   - Fixed src/app/admin/button-showcase/page.tsx
   - Updated src/app/admin/events/[id]/[eventId]/registrations/page.tsx
   - Fixed email service imports

7. ✅ Updated app page imports:
   - Updated all Button imports to use shared/components/ui/button
   - Updated AuthCheck imports to use shared module
   - Updated EventList imports to use features/events

## Remaining Tasks

1. ⬜ Fix remaining component imports:

   - Update other app pages not covered in the initial pass
   - Check other remaining components like DeleteConfirmationModal and RegistrationFormModal
   - Ensure all pages use the new feature structure

2. ⬜ Finish moving remaining components:

   - Move any components not yet moved to appropriate feature folders
   - Delete the old components once all references have been updated

3. ⬜ Testing:
   - Test all functionality to ensure nothing was broken in the refactoring
   - Verify all components render correctly

## How to Proceed

1. Complete one feature area at a time:

   - Continue updating all files related to registration
   - Then update all files related to events
   - Finally update all files related to admin

2. Use search and replace:

   - Replace `import ... from "~/components/..."` with the new paths
   - Replace `import ... from "~/types/..."` with feature-specific types
   - Replace `import ... from "~/hooks/..."` with feature-specific hooks

3. Remove duplicates at the end:
   - Once all references have been updated, remove the old files
   - Keep a backup of the old structure until everything is verified

## Benefits of the New Structure

The new structure provides several benefits:

1. **Better organization** - Code is organized by feature domain rather than technical role
2. **Improved maintainability** - Related code is kept together
3. **Clearer boundaries** - Each feature has clear responsibilities
4. **Easier to navigate** - Developers can find related code more easily
5. **More scalable** - Makes it easier to add new features or modify existing ones
